We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US:

To win you must avoid getting the scoring cards. Or you can Shoot the Moon. The game is over when one of the four players gains more or exactly 100 points. You win if you have the smallest score. Though chance is involved you can still make the best of your cards and win. Download and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ��� ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Advanced AI players \r\n✓ 3 Difficulty Levels\r\n✓ Balanced rules\r\n✓ Intuitive interface \r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ You can keep low and try to earn the lowest score by avoiding cards of hearts and especially by avoiding the 13-points Queen of ♠Spades. \r\n✓ Another strategy is to go big and take all the hearts and the Queen of ♠Spades, in which case you \"Shoot the Moon\". It will either take 26 points away or add 26 points to all your opponents. When at least one player goes over or reaches 100 points the game is over.\r\n✓ The scoring cards are the cards of hearts, each worth 1 point, and the Queen of ♠Spades, worth 13 points. Whoever plays the highest card of the suit that started the trick collects the trick. The value of the cards grows in this order 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.\r\n✓ 13 cards are dealt to each player. Before every hand, each player has to choose 3 cards and pass them to another player with one exception. For every fourth hand no cards are passed. The player holding the 2♣ of clubs must lead to begin the first trick.\r\n✓ Players must follow suit. If you don't have a card of the suit which started the trick you can place any card.\r\n✓ Players can start tricks with a card from any suit, with one exception: the cards of hearts. Placing a card of hearts in the trick for the first time is called breaking the hearts. Once the hearts are broken you can start a trick with a card of hearts.\r\n✓ Sometimes you can collect all the scoring cards and thus you shoot the moon. In most cases you will receive 0 points and the others will each receive 26 points.\r\n✓ However, if by adding 26 points to other players they gain more than 100 points, but you still lose, another solution is preferred. In this case 26 points will be subtracted from your score and all the other players will keep their scores.\r\n✓ By default the set difficulty is easy. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change it from easy to medium, from medium to hard or from hard to easy.

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance.

His freedom will now be at risk, because a hunter has landed on the island to add this rare animal to his private zoo.\r\nThis tiny bird with the name fector will have to keep his eyes wide open in order to escape from his enemies hands.\r\n\r\nYour task will be to try and help our fluffy friend to keep his life as it is and rescue him, from what could become a real dungeon.\r\nAppeal to all your abilities to get him out of trouble, dodge big waterfalls, rocks and do not get cached from the hunter’s net. Land on the beach to kick the crabs back in the water and then take off quickly.  \r\nRemember to fly always within the confines of the island delimited by the beach, as the ocean is hiding a big danger.  In fact the island is permanently being controlled by a hungry shark that is always waiting for a new tasty pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\t\r\n\r\n- Easy touch and tilt control\r\n- Original 3D-run function combines jumping, turning and change of altitude (nosedive).\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- One of the coolest animal apps to play with!\r\n- The never-ending mega game\r\n- 3 different game modes: Run (normal), slow (easy), fast (hard)\r\n- Special abilities:\r\n- Lightning: Makes you fly much faster (at a nearly uncontrollable speed)\r\n- Snail: Resets your speed to normal (slows you down)\r\n- Green flare: Makes you invincible for 10 seconds (The only thing you have to remember is to turn at every corner)\r\n\r\nAdvise: Be a good vactor and catch the Snails on the ground during your rush to slow down the speed and increase the possibility of getting farther.\r\n\r\nWarning: Avoid the lightning power up that are suspended in the air, as it will give you a super turbo boost that makes you incredibly fast, but you will probably quickly lose control of the flappy bird. The only way to stop the high speed is to take a snail.\r\n\r\n3, 2, 1 go! Start your cartoon running adventure!\r\n\r\nThis is a fun and free application.

The new versions of the game are much brighter and diverse. Retris is one of the best in our opinion, although one can find dozens of Bricks, Blocks, Pentomino and 1010!-like games in the Internet. But it is still essentially the same game that was originally Quadris (classic puzzle Tetris).\r\n\r\nYou can choose number of figures – 9 as in the classical version; 11 – a mix of three and four bricks; Pentax, 17 – all the figures. You can moderate type of figure movement (fluent/intermittent), initial speed, figure colors (as in Tetcolor). At the same time there are no frills, and classic Tetris and Tetcolor lovers might grow fond of it.\r\n\r\nRetris has two color modes: in the first one all pieces of a certain type consist of blocks of the same color. The bottom part that is not burned is composed of disparate units if mixed colors - the remnants of the thrown shapes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is when a falling figure is composed of red blocks, and the bottom blocks (made of the fallen ones)  are blue.\r\n\r\nRetris provides an opportunity to show a transparent grid that divides a figure into blocks.\r\n\r\nThe game can show a “phantom” – an identical “twin” of a falling figure to help you see where it is better to place it.\r\n\r\nOne can choose a mode of control type in Quadris: if you prefer to play holding your smartphone or tablet with two hands, you can select a mode in which the control buttons are situated to the left and to the right from the game field.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option \"play with one hand\" in Quadris, the control buttons are placed to the right from the playing field on your smartphone or tablet screen.\r\n\r\nYou can compete with other players as in many other puzzle games. It is possible to play anonymously or to register and get your unique nickname. After that your results get into the global chart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the auto-save function if your game is interrupted by a call or any other program switch on the smartphone!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n- Create horizontal lines using the falling blocks;\r\n- When you make a line of blocks, it is cleared from the screen;\r\n- The game is over when the blocks pile up and reach the top of the screen;\r\n- You get more points for completing multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nYou can play the new version of Quadris either online and offline. The game may be of interest both to adult fans of the classic Tetris game and to attract the younger generation, it is as easy to use as educational online games.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of classic puzzle games – Tetris and other related puzzle games like Quadris, Pentax, etc. – has been repeatedly studied by scientists. If one believes their opinion, downloading a free puzzle game (like Quadris or Tetris), you get both a free shrink and a free nutritionist – it is believed that classic puzzle and logic games may relieve stress, may help to ease one’s condition after psychological problems and may reduce the risk of overeating by switching attention to the game. As opposed to the \"shooters\", Quadris and other classic puzzles can calm, giving a feeling that you put your life in order and under control along with the blocks on the playing field.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and join the wonderful company of smart puzzle-crackers!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"}],"Title":"Top free
