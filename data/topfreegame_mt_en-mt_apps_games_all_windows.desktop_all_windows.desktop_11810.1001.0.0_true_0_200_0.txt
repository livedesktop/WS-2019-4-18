We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLL03","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toca Boo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35509.9007199266427196.a0742277-0f4d-4235-805f-881870ee7be0.4790ad25-088c-4744-9cde-dd94a4af6b32","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7068.9007199266427196.17d3af26-b513-4ce3-ad9f-3b202d037b91.fbb77568-7ddc-4052-b7ff-da4cebf030aa","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1404.9007199266427196.3940dcdf-0ef7-46b4-99c7-fc2e0fa2271c.4b1be38f-db30-49fe-821d-53071efe6d92","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19375.9007199266427196.d0c9827e-647f-4e96-b5c2-999e1c569e9f.be535a6a-14aa-42be-ad31-357cf8fe3a26","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8216.9007199266427196.8875f313-6508-4bee-8d32-17265c79a543.c0ca5ccd-12dd-42b2-9a63-41a3f14ba5e4","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17193.9007199266427196.32065797-4f2b-40df-8bce-6db36b85cb30.dfb063c9-7670-432e-9905-cc45ac53e9a6","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TocaBocaAB.TocaBoo_e8swm3qhs311t"],"ContentIds":["ae25ac77-3d59-e39f-5539-54ac9d85662a","acfb155a-452c-ba99-38cf-0d9b2da20667"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"BOO! \r\nDid I scare you!?

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1ZLFF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Death Race Stunt Moto","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1628.13510798886204228.cb720a9c-f662-4784-a718-2bdd50f42316.6864e1c2-cc63-4ae4-b201-7ed5d4d5c53b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9084.13510798886204228.3c018560-9018-48e4-ba50-9c916845c2c9.0960fd61-0f24-4f2c-a7a7-5d6bf1bb00c7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38727.13510798886204228.3dcfff6c-e233-4fc8-803d-c8ddd33d4909.3aa9e0b0-e258-4318-9658-02095834ce50","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.DeathRaceStuntMoto_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["c656c455-d835-5209-d9ed-5f9ba9d0a091","ed55a42f-5df2-1cc0-d92c-4d5fe8528a1d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Strap on the helmet, pull over the safety guards and be prepared for the extreme race on the daredevil’s ride!

The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VQBR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Geometry Jump - Impossible Dash","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39809.13510798887509708.6acfa630-4616-4a26-9418-dcb9b82427a8.6a27fa4f-9f24-48ea-aba4-72917df80106","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59445.13510798887509708.c8300b71-36b4-421f-b53a-1d31c686ecd5.d55b20fa-af6c-4c0d-b43c-2de5cb3591a5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48385.13510798887509708.525369e1-2fd2-4b60-ac01-c520cc847a72.20adeb55-9c0e-4537-9a5b-5f8b3dc9ac1d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["9741BabyStepStudio.GeometryJump-ImpossibleDash_pd4zc2nfw6kwj"],"ContentIds":["be44f8ca-52a5-cc85-5a40-edfb3957065f","3a9f1192-b936-f573-4004-937d6439babf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Completely Free alternative Game to Geometry Dash and The Impossible Game .\r\nFly and flip your way in the fun and challenging spike obstacles.

NEW: AI Robot \"Pablo\" will walk you through the basics. \r\n\r\nTeleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. \r\n\r\nFeeling energy for action? Try our multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHP3FM9SRTV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Batman: The Enemy Within - The Telltale Series","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39890.13622106627511667.650ed635-504c-4b2b-9445-d5c67560f40b.0897af3a-46bd-4c56-8956-cdba54ac6896","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24334.13622106627511667.4d7bf4a1-d615-4c88-b584-d2fdfa187c95.a6358437-0c42-43aa-b387-5072a15d5084","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57857.13622106627511667.3ae6648f-4814-4e95-88fd-4a6896c94515.737fd0ee-6e22-4002-9603-78e3df297008","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60211.13622106627511667.756114be-0239-4ef2-a3df-542861f64ac0.51223266-c2e8-4a0f-bd11-7097d4a32ac9","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65442.13622106627511667.47ad2e42-067b-4615-a5e8-4511ab333fa0.39aa7edd-0651-4784-9885-506a33ca8c54","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11638.13622106627511667.0f26b21b-96b5-4ffb-9896-62d2580f2512.826a7495-bf56-4f7c-86b0-f377bae262a1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TelltaleGames.BatmanTheEnemyWithin-TheTelltaleSeri_4p9dzwrngadje"],"ContentIds":["b21b6823-85ab-30fc-d29e-ce592d29c583","7eb481a2-17ec-0d91-6b2c-8e1a140f6bdd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In this latest chapter from the award-winning studio behind Batman - The Telltale Series, both Bruce Wayne and Batman will be forced into precarious new roles.

The shapes currently included are circle, rectangle, triangle, square, rhombus and oval.\r\n\r\n★ What won't my children learn?\r\n\r\nThe game does not overload children and parents with too many audio and visual stimuli. Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won't be practicing during this game. Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer for your children to play the game silently, you can give your child headphones.\r\n\r\nOnce your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time – and learning!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG1V9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Secret Society - Hidden Mystery","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31731.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.231aab0f-a40e-4852-86cb-61f8ed968fd3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56431.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.58bcabca-826a-4bfc-9fc7-99f4885f0fe1","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3320.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.43c02b7a-c8dc-476c-aea0-2c827c33e7d0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14496.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.ba589e8c-eca2-4f9b-a1d5-f97e8fc92aca","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2308.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.1de79de9-db1c-47af-9072-1b4a0bf8586e","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32240.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.40439041-9a11-4e7f-9c30-f47103363707","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23284.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.6b79f898-a382-4ac8-9039-e825e33dc671","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39626.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.add0ce3a-dd1d-4492-800c-02da04687d4b","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49903.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.225904fe-a78a-4bd5-93c7-46ca978cb1bd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62269.9007199266304174.1868eac8-a9a4-486a-900e-93731dd1133a.4ecedcae-32f8-4f50-9b24-8dd4a05ab1d8","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"39","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.TheSecretSociety-HiddenMystery_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["86f4f1bf-59ae-19cf-3b44-176885a43c25","076fc4eb-6fc5-e9ee-70b1-39ad10db366c","0daf8426-2815-35fc-0b25-3221576f34c9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LIMITED TIME OFFER!

Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.
