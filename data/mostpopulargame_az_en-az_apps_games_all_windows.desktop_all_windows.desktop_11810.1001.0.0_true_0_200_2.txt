This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PH81CN4KB2Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Checkers King","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46762.14240823578015518.adab5e2d-54b3-4a9b-ae64-50a8cf605277.0017947a-e808-4ee1-9faa-fb901df3ece2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#571c01","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44769.14240823578015518.a8016ae9-d37a-4b76-9d51-42a9228e863f.fbcd0bd4-a706-43c6-aae4-ae1a1a7c62cc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#571c01","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46981.14240823578015518.adab5e2d-54b3-4a9b-ae64-50a8cf605277.c0c0985c-3a6c-46ab-9ed2-c0d74c6112b9","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46762.14240823578015518.adab5e2d-54b3-4a9b-ae64-50a8cf605277.0017947a-e808-4ee1-9faa-fb901df3ece2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#571c01","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28916.14240823578015518.9c04b8b3-39e1-40a3-befa-786aedb6263a.bc6eedfb-cb21-4d43-bd92-fae37d607e3f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["15985Yasindewid.CheckersKing_39dp1177718dj"],"ContentIds":["459d2885-9820-7e06-2b63-5bca4641792f","577b36de-943f-51e0-7c8d-c8fe9376406b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Checkers King is a board game (Draughts, dame, damas – various languages) is well-known ancient game, that still very popular over the world for its simple rules and addictive game play, which hide deep tactics and variability.\r\nIntuitive touch controls make it easy to play checkers, just tap a piece and then tap where you want it to go.\r\nCheckers King supports both 1 player and 2 player game play, so you can play against friends or test your skills against a challenging computer opponent.\r\nI hope you enjoy playing Checkers King with your friends or your family.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRD2Z6R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Police Bus Hill Climb -

Prove it!\r\n\r\nThe faster you go, the more amazing your tricks will be.\r\n\r\nWhy is Stickman hook so perfect?\r\n- Because you can swing like a spider\r\n- Because your stickman dances at the end of each game (We challenge you to reproduce his dance)\r\n- Because there is a grappling hook (and grapples are cool, right?)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NV6NK4TF9J7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Makeover Dress Up Girl Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13755.14400188988172436.d0f8a110-afe2-4945-b3fe-1b5758472920.1ea74d39-92ac-4c9b-b800-55605e8677eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37505.14400188988172436.d0f8a110-afe2-4945-b3fe-1b5758472920.2bb78c1b-3e1e-4f10-aa01-e18c3981b6ab","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9052.14400188988172436.6134b9c8-b81a-4b58-8cba-4e33f2657a1f.dbb75a47-358c-4422-8560-b2e516b2e677","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2866pubteamsix.MakeoverDressUpGirlGames_pjpw6cxt3h6br"],"ContentIds":["f5c412f6-342d-3e1e-bdb1-a26b315f237e","8767606c-74dc-2072-77b3-74814647dbdc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"***Makeover Dress Up Girl Games***  is a collection of some of the best games and makeover games for girls.

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQX65","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Death Drive: Racing Thrill","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37350.9007199266544510.6ae1d73a-a382-4d8b-8472-1e441aa8a372.79be7c81-2a27-4601-a1f0-fe3089c2684a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35366.9007199266544510.c5feada7-b6d7-4b82-9848-649b81f526c3.d4c24038-6cc1-4295-bb57-adbb1d0de196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["PlayBuffStudiosPrivateLim.DeathDriveRacingThrill_vx8mmcwfbtyhc"],"ContentIds":["22072212-1f0c-cadb-c1cf-37c9309aef28"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"When ACTION meets RACING, thrill moves to another level !! \r\n\r\nAre you ready with your Gears and Guns?
