You can also drag & drop to move cards;\r\n♠ Natural animations, relaxing graphics and a very intuitive interface;\r\n\r\n♦♦ HOW TO PLAY ♦♦\r\n\r\n♣ In this game you have to build up 4 stacks of cards of the same suit in each of the 4 foundation piles from the top of the screen. Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n♣ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n♣ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n♣ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n♣ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the level. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n♣ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

But for the past few months, our detective has been hot on the trail of the demonic preacher she fought one year ago. Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \r\n\r\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold… \r\n\r\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family’s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \r\n\r\nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park…\r\n\r\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching. Sinister shadows lurk behind the park’s enchanting scenery and the wary glances of its overly-polite employees. Is this place connected to Maple Creek, and the preacher? \r\n\r\nWho is the mysterious prisoner she meets on the forest path – someone stalking her every move, or a possible ally? Is she merely a puppet being used in forces from outside our world, or will she finally resolve the evil events that began one year before?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCCV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49481.9007199266251559.333b6c5a-3099-45d1-8277-00faa49e859a.e45e40d1-fc1e-4ab0-9344-4771eb7ff8a1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19332.9007199266251559.096722c9-cada-4ddc-950f-fb8c900ef9f6.8f6bcb8f-121e-4de0-b5e9-82b1512303ed","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64367.9007199266251559.0c03fe5d-d098-4495-8d70-a9b4d9ea94e6.5428c8f7-5ae6-42a2-b536-c173203f3a66","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.31431.9007199266251559.6b7843a8-9b21-43df-b9a4-30d58792571e.abd2f82f-3230-47b3-b6a8-c9aabc161ee6","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32044.9007199266251559.45645ccb-5701-48d5-bac3-1be4140bf973.e910b37a-7227-42cb-8b76-d1a0373d0d4a","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3291.9007199266251559.5f86d3ba-b682-48ca-b190-d1191e98710b.33ae3e56-e0ea-40e0-a4a1-d4c08a347a52","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.1631.9007199266251559.a200b667-45a7-4df4-b14a-da2895b904ad.e29da590-824a-4ec9-94cd-8ff6f0b3adec","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3F302C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"45","PackageFamilyNames":["ReflectionIT.SudokuFree_h3qw2m3pefnrp"],"ContentIds":["aa16e888-2f83-1daf-cf7b-081d73c6defe","37dd8c80-0e25-04d4-129e-a3a92d859fd1","402cca99-9ed5-abc1-aa84-2e1a80d72f89"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play standard 9x9 grid Sudoku puzzles.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCG8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Shopping Cart Hero 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40021.9007199266251759.c3242002-c3b1-4179-8f7b-7d9672921eb0.1d9cc552-a980-4410-8572-57b66675ba34","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0F6D87","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47567.9007199266251759.8ecff69d-1685-4d3e-bc66-3fb3628fa7d8.7a1b9d61-0acc-42b4-b5f0-dcac2fa1db46","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0F6D87","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"13","PackageFamilyNames":["MonkeyWantBanana.ShoppingCartHero3_wqtp7yr9d8y40"],"ContentIds":["b248492b-50c3-a95a-9078-06412ccc4b73","31d63499-0f05-babd-0973-e70e54a32296"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Shopping Cart Hero 3 returns with more action than ever before!  \r\n\r\nAn addicting jumper that will keep you coming back for more, Shopping Cart Hero 3 takes the adventure to all new locations to jump and explore.

You’ve just found the most original coin dozer casino simulator that blends perfectly with your world explorer and treasure hunting games taste! Our unique arcade provides not only the classic coin dropper gameplay, but it mixes it with a treasure hunt for giving you a unique coin dozer experience in different level locations like: Treasure Cave, Gold of Ra, Diamond Rock & Temple of Venus!\r\n\r\nThe infamous red-bearded pirate left behind his treasure maps!  It seems like your luck already started changing because now, you have all the treasures locations. Begin your treasure hunt quest now, to collect all the coins & prizes of the huge lots inside the chests. Be careful though; the red-bearded pirate left some traps & fake treasure chests to keep safe his gold coins & jewels. The traps can cause that most of the coins and goodies fall to the sides of the dozer machine; so be really careful when you tap!\r\n\r\n💰🔦💰 Let the treasures chase & the coin dash dozer fun action begins! Download NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest and enjoy the tons of prizes & high winning rates! 💰🔦💰\r\n\r\nNot familiar with Coin Dozer free games rules? No problem! It works almost the same like the real coin pusher games machines, and you’ll see a short video tutorial. Tap the pusher to make coins drop on it. All the coins or prizes that fall on the sides won’t be counted on your balance. The main goal is to drop coins & have them pushing over the front edge of the platforms. Our game includes incredible boosters that will help you on your cash collect quest. Check every booster special power & actions in the help section to build your winner strategy! Use the power ups wisely, as some of them don’t regenerate so fast as others. Gain XP points to increase your experience bar and unlock more maps and game levels. Our dozer can compete with the best prize claw machines or simulators in rewards matter; but unlike the claw machine, your chances of winning are much higher!\r\n\r\n🎊💀🎊 Collect all the special items like gold bars or secret boxes to conquer all the secret rewards hidden among the chests treasures! Try NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest FREE for limited time only! 🎊💀🎊\r\n\r\nIf you get stuck, use the Shake option; every collected coin fills your Shake meter. You can activate it when it reaches one of the three levels: Low, Medium or High. Activating this feature shakes the table making the coins on the edge fall off the table. Collect 4 or more coins at once to trigger a Coin Attack; this will create and spread special goodies, prizes and puzzle pieces. Once you collect all the gold puzzle pieces, 12 to be exact, you’ll open the secret door of the room which contains a huge amount of rewards. Puzzle mini games unlock at level 5, and from there each level of our dozer has a puzzle mini-game to solve. Keep gaining XP to collect all the surprise rewards waiting for you!\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGXZKW8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Prime World: Defenders","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47406.13510798883898729.8ea4645b-ccf6-41de-a89b-f152a2b6f158.fdfd0e93-48bb-42d1-bca3-0c916877ffdc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63910.13510798883898729.2ed9f228-15f9-41dc-bcbd-dbb90bc44d2e.94f76f23-72e3-41ed-8546-13575ab86213","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3540.13510798883898729.b472fa93-7419-41af-8020-8c9e7dc233bc.16145909-8767-4e44-bfa8-124115480b56","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36516.13510798883898729.278dbda5-510a-4114-8643-3098acfa5b8e.4a81762a-4a6b-4a5d-bcc3-26d192e2586a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8207.13510798883898729.8d97dffa-636e-4a94-892f-2ddb0eda7a32.f802b410-d3e8-4006-b7f8-3bbe3cfa4d3d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15404.13510798883898729.8544c4c1-e8dd-441f-9785-3f9c54b2f29d.e0c2341a-df70-4351-b477-bc68376c973d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35032.13510798883898729.74d2b23f-d9d7-42d1-bd2f-8d55ad267ec0.027a90df-c69e-4dcf-8ee3-11925e74959f","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36178.13510798883898729.0767d6ba-6e0f-4b64-a8cd-8ba86affba70.b6292caf-99a1-463e-bb7a-48437d76f3b8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"24","PackageFamilyNames":["4EA62672.PrimeWorldDefenders_twpb7cgm4b9wy"],"ContentIds":["6585f359-97f6-67bd-cb33-8e44bf8b070c","d3544611-35eb-7ae1-a499-ae61936c69bc","3bc220d4-f955-4aab-a546-f639f723adc2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“The graphics are fantastic and the few changes in an established formula makes for a great little game” - tech-tongue.com\r\n\r\n“Getting strong towers and magic and using them intelligently is a lot of fun, especially since there’s no arbitrary energy to limit how much you can play” - TechnologyTell.com\r\n\r\n“Go check it out, defenders” - Droid-Life.com\r\n\r\nEnter the Prime’s World Universe and destroy countless enemies with towers and magic.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1RJM7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"City Sniper: Military Encounter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47545.13510798886171550.a7e4a84f-148e-46ec-a9a2-0c092db7e3ef.c666d3f3-5fe1-4419-bd93-174127ceba29","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35203.13510798886171550.345d95e9-ab9f-45a6-96b6-a89bd93ba78f.a358e88a-e0a3-40c7-a03c-e0ee67e1a902","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23102.13510798886171550.ba5002a4-cbd0-4566-82bf-f1dece25ebd3.c52cfcf7-3eb6-474b-8b05-10d05e1b3e5d","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27604.13510798886171550.4e131129-3566-4d52-91de-24b024f3da81.046f6b09-4653-4be5-906b-c9d83e1d56d9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34335.13510798886171550.1c04cb57-f5d7-4aaa-8836-da1bb5ffc7b6.b19c898e-e949-48d1-8bb3-13269eb5fc78","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.45821.13510798886171550.a20e5f70-cea2-4d45-9635-cd5ea52538d0.aee300db-40c7-456a-aa06-78d973be4b77","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["41101SoftianZ.CitySniperMilitaryEncounter_3vpmez24nj5ct"],"ContentIds":["7e7ff845-0b1b-d5f0-95fa-4a325ab5134b","a9c66317-1080-6bc1-833d-24e064bf3294"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"City Sniper : Military Encounter gives you the best sniper shooting game of war experience for Free with the Best controls and realistic War games shooting environment.

This is absolute madness as the block has been turned into a dead zone jungle. It is time to defend national pride and bring in the big guns. This invasion calls for direct action!\r\n\r\nIt is up to heroic little you to defend the neighbourhood. In this epic turret defence game you are building an army of block defenders with unique skills. You will need to use your fantasy and imagination to conquer the Blockheads once and for all!\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL WEAPONS\r\nLuckily you have some toys to your disposal that can push back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nBouncer:\r\nBouncers throw tiny bombs that do quite some splash damage. Cheap to build, but has limited range and is best used in large numbers. Summoning bouncers is always a good idea!\r\n\r\nSniper:\r\nShoots enemies from a great distance with a powerful shot. This tower unit has a very wide range and can easily snipe baddies from a far. Unfortunately the sniper does need quite some time to reload itself, but it remains your strongest long range shooter.\r\n\r\nFan:\r\nThe fan unit is not developed to provide a cool breeze in the heat of battle. Instead this fan is very powerful and slows down the approaching army of enemies with a sonic blast. Your other units can then take time and annihilate the competition! Range is quite limited so it is best to place this unit at junctions and close to your other towers.\r\n\r\nTesla turret:\r\nEvery strategy game needs a tesla coil right? This is the most powerful of your units, but also one of the most expensive. It has good range and does a lot of damage. Reload time is relatively quick and it fries enemies with a powerful electrical laser. This is hell-fire of the highest order!\r\n\r\nTurbolaser (from a certain galaxy):\r\nIn later levels you will need this powerful anti air unit as it is the only Block Defender that can shoot flying enemy types. Its X - ray range is limited and you will most likely need a couple of these to counter incoming squadrons. Luckily they are relatively cheap to produce. It can not defend against ground based targets.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS\r\nThese weapons should be sufficient and up to the task. The biggest challenge however, especially in later levels are your economics. You will find that you might need to sell units on the fly in order to purchase new ones. Robots and Blockheads are relentless in their march and it is key to pay attention to where the threat is coming from and what the best counter measures are!\r\n\r\nIn short Block Defender offers a real challenge and with episode unlocks there is always something new just around the corner. And you know what they say - a strategy game a day keeps the brain doctor away!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n+ 3 worlds to conquer\r\n+ 30 challenging levels to complete\r\n+ Defend against land, sea and air units \r\n+ 5 powerful units to master (4 ground / 1 air)\r\n+ Many different enemy types to defeat\r\n+ Lite or premium game-play\r\n+ Unique graphical style","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH691QK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cargo Crane Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52758.13510798886678278.1bee9c4e-559d-4159-82e7-72d4bcce4dc1.20bca661-41c8-417a-a73a-d7fc42e9f2b5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10165.13510798886678278.05226ad5-cffa-42d6-9d6c-068baf914529.482784b3-dd98-4f6b-b4fe-e7a856aa2fd7","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7936.13510798886678278.6df75ff4-32f5-4437-b419-2070c1726a51.dd82d7b7-0a63-411f-9ba1-6a87d65e8958","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43086.13510798886678278.c0bb4493-989f-419f-b92b-9693c936347b.768e1579-506b-4080-8649-7e4b9ffef042","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9488.13510798886678278.2015735c-d9f2-4d97-95f1-18678f8d9ffc.fd50e698-15d9-4821-b152-dc2d1ac3948e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22641.13510798886678278.4280ba4b-ded0-4c52-9d35-4ee45666cfd9.f6fa2573-810e-48db-9527-1a3353272943","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48563.13510798886678278.e4466a9a-d267-4c88-9c0a-54eb49ddcd44.c7d1cae1-985c-4dc0-b3cd-5e7c1b690913","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55747.13510798886678278.b60e9528-c9bd-4ade-b60e-63c596db084a.494ee5b2-d7e8-4cc6-b4cc-2b413e9efe31","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34259GameCanvas.CargoCraneSimulator_69qvq4vcm5k9t"],"ContentIds":["54a65cab-b0ed-7ad1-990e-11777dbfd467","4ea4d902-38e5-4859-36bd-b9ac37313ed4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get ready to play the best ever mega lifter crane simulation game like never before.

It's hard to discover what makes rolling those dice over and over again so fun, but it's beyond delight when you finally see those sixes line up. \r\n\r\nYahtzee is a simple brain game that trains analytical thinking. It's a classic board dice game.\r\nThe objective of Yahtzee is to score the highest possible score within the 13 rounds of the game. Players roll five dice in order to make the desired combinations, which have different fixed or variable point values. The results of each turn are recorded on a special score sheet.\r\n\r\nYahtzee is played with five dice. This popular game, lasts for 13 rounds as the players roll the dice and attempt to complete various combinations. The rules of Yahtzee are simple, and the game remains popular among people of all ages. Simply roll the dice, make your choices and score some points. At the end of the 13 turns, the player with the highest point total wins the game\r\nDo the best dice combination in the this multiplayer Yahtzee pro game. Half of the fun of this game is to yell out the game's name if and when you roll one. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls and all five dice are the same number. Rolling five \"sixes\" is the best roll in the game. \r\n\r\nSpecial Yahtzee rule is, the first time you get a yahtzee in a game it is worth 50 points (if you use it in the yahtzee slot). If you roll another yahtzee after you have already got the 50 points (i.e., you didn’t take a zero), you will get a 100 point bonus.\r\n\r\nThe Yahtzee scorecard or sheet contains 13 scoring boxes divided between two sections: \r\n1) Upper section \r\n2) Lower section\r\n\r\nIt is a game of great chance, luck and also of smart thinking and strategy. If you are a Yahtzee pro addict then this is the best game for you to play online with your buddies.\r\n\r\nDownload and play this free Yahtzee HD  game and enjoy all the fun strategy elements that come along with this classic dice game.\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Yahtzee Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Play with Facebook Friends or as Guest \r\n✔ Easy to Learn\r\n✔ Addictive gameplay\r\n\r\nPlease rate and give your feedback for Yahtzee for further improving the game.\r\nWe will be grateful to hear your opinions and improve - whenever needed - in future

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKX1Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Absolute RC Heli Sim","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54373.9007199266532132.01b761c3-4b88-436b-8370-0c40b842cbe9.9ba741ae-88e8-477c-9a00-c6a4747988ea","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1710.9007199266532132.dca7d308-af97-4056-8fed-cfa43faa8dbb.9e9f4427-b3b1-413d-8e75-8f4a1b6b89a8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16783.9007199266532132.78d6c620-e8ca-4a28-8c42-e95d96e74ca7.9094133d-f25c-4e0b-9321-7a964616ea06","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22097.9007199266532132.837ef88e-618d-467a-9775-0f53fa6cce06.5d7dc924-f998-4d43-aa8d-98931643c279","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42865.9007199266532132.aa60bad7-2f2e-4ab9-970f-242eff9251f0.e3a8e3da-c452-48e5-a33e-427f33187625","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15036.9007199266532132.0a08287b-4774-4b6f-ac80-9efbc825bed5.f28fd706-9f15-4777-8190-40c2896dd3d9","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.9,"RatingsCount":"17","PackageFamilyNames":["HappyBytesLLC.AbsoluteRCHeliSim_rje7kk43mr05c"],"ContentIds":["b78ed3c6-fa98-cd43-9074-01ff18b882b3","9333b69a-5d49-60b3-38cd-498a0c91a1ef","7373158c-3cb8-2482-512c-fe2c9ad6e127"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Free RC helicopter simulator. Realistic model behavior, lifelike heli models and flying fields. Do not fly your real model before trying this program! Will save you many $$$ and days in waiting for model parts. Crashing model here cost nothing. Learn to fly without fear. Rain or wind outside, start flying right now! \r\n\r\nThe program includes many popular helicopter models of different type:\r\n- Beginners co-axial models\r\n- Entry level collective pitch models\r\n- Advanced fully 3D aerobatic models\r\n- High fidelity scale models\r\n\r\nWe also include many RC plane models, RC boat and RC car models. This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2.

They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ0N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31670.9007199266438783.608d1e9f-946a-475c-8fa3-fb013108b76f.d1a00048-bf4e-4380-b822-47b4f734b416","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12759.9007199266438783.76a8d8d5-0839-40d7-afb8-c18936974284.c1e10216-8b84-4a70-a801-e9c6f03ab92a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SpiderFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["36c317a0-65c4-4f2d-0019-1053e835a3a3","9316fd81-8525-e96a-d197-14cf6648a3fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most popular version of Spider Solitaire was introduced in Windows 98. The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
